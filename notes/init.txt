superset of JS
same syntax as JS, but adds somthing extra to it.
(Strong typing system like java,c++)
(Extra capabilities by adding type to JS)

allows developers to bind the type to variables nd func return statements. That helps to remove all type error during runtime

suppose we are trying to access any property of obj which is not there.
Then in ts we will get err before executin of program itself.
But in js we vl get error during runtime 

TS uses compile time type checking. It checks if the specified types match before running the  code,
not while runnig code


setup in local system 
Node JS, TS Compiler, VS Code
node -v -> version of the node 
npm install -g typescript --> ts compiler 
tsc -v  -> after installation verify

to complile (.ts files):-
tsc filename.ts (--watch for watch mode)
it vl create a js file. Run it using node
node filename.js
